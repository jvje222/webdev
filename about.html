      <h1>Background Information</h1>
    </header>
      <article class="aboutme_background">
        <p>I am from a small town in Ohio called Springboro that is between Dayton and Cincinnati. I love playing and watching all sports, especially soccer. Soccer has been apart of my family for generations and has taught me a lot about needing to work hard to show improvement and to become better. My skills of multitasking have been put to the test ever since high school with the struggle of managing my time between school, sports, and work. This has transitioned into college by adjusting to a whole new environment and still being about to manage my time. A fun fact about me is that I graduated high school with enough college credits to almost be considered a first-year Sophmore.</p>

      <h1>Personality Traits</h1>

      <article class="aboutme_traits">
        <p>Personally, time management is a key trait to being successful in my future because it allows me to complete my tasks in a given time when compared to others. During my freshman year of college, I was challenged with being apart of the Business Living Learning Program, rushing a fraternity, participating in intramural sports, and taking upper-level classes while adjusting being a college student away from home. Another trait that is important to me is to be a team player. I have been playing all different kinds of sports my whole life and I've learned that it is difficult to be successful if the whole time is not working together. Some other traits that describe me are that I am accountable, organized, flexible, and a good problem solver.</p>
