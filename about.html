      <article class="aboutme_intro">
        <p>My name is Jason Jewsikow and I am a Sophmore at the <i>University of Kentucky</i> majoring in Business Manageemnt and Information Communication Technology (ICT). Throughout this section I will provide some background information about who I am and some traits that have prepared me for the workforce. </p>

      <h1>Background Information</h1>
    </header>
      <article class="aboutme_background">
        <p>I am from a small town in Ohio called Springboro that is between Dayton and Cincinnati. I love playing and watching all sports, especially soccer. Soccer has been apart of my family for generations and has taught me a lot about needing to work hard in order to show improvement and to become better in anything. My skills of multitasking have been put to the test ever since high school with the struggle of managing my time between school, playing sports year around, and working on days I did not have practice. This schedule has transitioned into college by adjusting to a whole new environment and still being about to manage my time.  When I do have some free-time, I enjoy trying new things such as learning how to photoshop, do basic coding, and play sports with friends. I also spend time vunterring at a nonprofit called <a href="https://4pawsforability.org/">4Paws for Ability</a>. This organization means a lot to my family and I since we love dogs and we are able to train service dogs to help people in need. A fun fact about me is that I graduated high school with enough college credits to be considered a first-year Sophmore. I was able to accomplish this by taking college classes at a local community college throughout my Junior and Senior years. </p>

      <h1>Personality Traits</h1>
    </header>
      <article class="aboutme_traits">
        <p>Personally, time management is the most important trait to being successful in my future because it allows me to complete all of my tasks in a given time when compared to others. During my freshman year of college, I was challenged with being apart of the Business Living Learning Program, pledging for a fraternity, participating in intramural sports, and taking upper-level classes while adjusting being a college student away from home. Another trait that is important to me is to be a team player. I have been playing all different kinds of sports my whole life and I've learned that it is difficult to be successful if the whole time is not working together. Some other traits that describe me are that I am accountable, organized, flexible, and a good problem solver. Proficient Internet and computer experience including Microsoft Office is a skill I have been applying to help others. My passion for technology has encouraged me to learn about all aspects of my daily devices which has given me the ability to fix and improve my friends and family problems in any aspect of their device's.</p>
