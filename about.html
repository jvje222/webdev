      <article class="aboutme_background">
        <p>I am from a small town in Ohio called Springboro that is inbetween Dayton and Cincinnati. My skills of mutitasking have been put to the test ever since high school with the struggle of managing my time between school, sports, and work. This has transitioned into college by adjusting to a whole new environment and still being about to mange my time. A fun fact about me is that I graduated high school with enough college credits to almost be considred a first-year Sophmore.</p>

      <article class="aboutme_traits">
        <p>Personally, time mangement is a key trait to being successful in my future because it allows me to complete my tasks in a given time when compared to others. During my freshman year of college, I was challenged with being apart of the Business Living Learning Program, rushing a fraternity, partcipating in intramural sports, and taking upper-level classes while adjusting being a college student away from home. Some other traits that describe me are that I am accountable, organized, flexible, and a good problem solver.</p>
