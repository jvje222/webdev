    <h1>The Past</h1>
  </header>
    <article class="accomp-past">
      <p>In this section, I will talk about how my past accomplishments have prepared me for the workforce and the goals I plan to achieve in the future. Throughout the past couple of years, I have been introduced to the workforce by working as a busboy for a restaurant called Chappy's Social House. I started working just before I turned 16 and worked there until I went to college. During those two years, I had been promoted to positions with more responsibility as a reward for my dedication and hard work ethic that I displayed every shift. These responsibilities include working as the barback and then a host while becoming a trainer for anyone who was accepted into any of those three positions. I was grateful for these opportunities to have more responsibilities because I was able to strengthen my business skills with various amounts of experience in different roles.</p>

    <h1>The Present</h1>

    <article class="accomp-present">
      <p>Currently I am taking time off from the workforce to be able to focus on getting my degree. I believe this will allow me to apply the materials learned from school into a job that relates to my degree and current interests. When I am not at school, I continue to volunteer at 4Paws for Ability and accoshionally work for the delivery service, DoorDash. DoorDash has helped me improve my customer satisfaction skills, multitasking skils, and the ability to work in fast-paced enviornments. .</p>
